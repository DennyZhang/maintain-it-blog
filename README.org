** Topics For IT Writing
*** Only Share Tips You Actively Use Everyday
1. If you need it quite often, people in the same field may also need it
- Live knowledge will grow and evolve.
*** Explore GitHub For Certain Topics
Let's say you want to write a blog post of "tmux". 
1. Search and explore all popular Github repos related to "tmux". 
- Understand their beautify and strengths, then write a blog post. 
- If necessary, start your own github repo about "tmux".
*** Introduce Latest Tech Trends In Your Field
Explore new things, and introduce them in a simple and easy language
** Lessons Learned
*** How To Write
- People are impatient
You only have 3-5 seconds to convince people to keep reading

- Visualize Your Audience And Use Case, And "Talk" To Them.
I talk to the audience/customers virtually. This would help to improve engaging people.

- Make the reading fluid.
If you can't deliver your thinking smoothly. People will simply leave. They don't even bother to leave you a complain.

- Avoid using vague or fuzzy statement.
People like meaningful details.
*** How To Promote
- Focus on your quality, instead of spreading to a bigger audience.
Bring crappy resource to a bigger audience? Do you really think it's a good thing, instead of a bad thing?

- Your Friends To Review Your New Posts.
You should have friends working in the same field. If your new doesn't serve your friends well, it won't work well for others.

- Leave comments to similar blogs
The main objective is not about bringing more traffic to your blog. It's about learning things from other bloggers, and make friends with them.

You're not competitors. You help each other to grow stronger and do better.
*** How To Get Benefits
- If your posts don't connvince people taking actions, your influence is low to the audience.

- Ask people to take small actions.
Blogging is about convincing. Make people take actions.

Ask people:
1. Try your advice in 5 minutes
- Follow you in SNS(LinkedIn, GitHub, etc)
- Send you private messages
- Share with their friends
- Leave you comments

Even if you're a frequent user of ngrok, I still recommend you to go over this post. It helps us to better understand the trick under the scene.
